# Predicting-Dementia-Risk-Using-Brain-Health-Indicators
This machine learning model predicts dementia risk through hierarchical decision boundaries. The architecture analyzes cognitive metrics (Executive Function, Global scores), age, and cardiovascular factors, achieving 70% accuracy and 78.6% True Positive Rate. Developed as my final project for NYU GSTEM's 2025 Winston Data Scholarship.
